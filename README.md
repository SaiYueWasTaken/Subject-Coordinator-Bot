## Subject-Coordinator-Bot
### Discord bot for coordinating different subjects at NTNU.

The Subject Coordinator bot builds a structure for discord servers concerned with integrating the Majors and subjects from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

## How does it work?

By reacting to a message in a channel dedicated to the bot, you can choose your study, year and other subjects of your choice.

This creates text channels dedicated to those who needs it, and the text channels stay invisible to those who aren't taking the subjects.
